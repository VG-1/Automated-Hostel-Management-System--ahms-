# Hostoura- Our Answer to Hostels
 
Hostoura is a website that will automate the whole process of Hostel Management for students ( specifically for my University i.e.. DAVV).Website main functionality is to automate the whole hostel system online, that includes from searching of Hostel to the final allocation of rooms.
It is a alternative to traditional hostel management system.
This website is made by me and my two colleagues.It is designed using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, Javascript,php, MySQL.
It's sole aim is to help students as well as administration.

In 4 words it is "Automated Hostel Management System".
